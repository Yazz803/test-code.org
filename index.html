      <p>The Sumatran elephant population in 2017 was 362. This figure is higher than in 2015 and 2016 which were only 84 and 115 individuals. Many factors trigger the scarcity of this large animal population. According to an explanation in the Journal of Biotic 6(1), poaching is the main factor. Meanwhile, other factors such as death from poison and the installation of electric currents in plant cultivation areas have also caused the population of these animals to decrease. Sumatran elephants have a characteristic weight of about 3 to 5 tons with a height of approximately 2-3 meters. This elephant's skin is lighter than other Asian elephants with reddish-white ears.</p>
